``

    Project

This is an attempt to create Sudoku Puzzle Solver which uses inference to find a solution, rather than brute force calculation. I am interested in sudoku puzzles and have a curiosity in optimising the solution.
The project will solve 9 by 9 puzzles. 

I have taken used this source on solving techniques for refernce.

Note that unfilled squares are filled in with 0.
    Aims of the project:

- take input from user
- write algorithms to solve puzzles using inference
- provide user with the solution.
- find all the options for each cell
- write tests
- backtracking algorithm
- log4j implementation 

Advanced:
- multithreading
- read a file containing sudoku puzzle and create file with solution
- check if puzzle is solvable.
- create solvable puzzles
